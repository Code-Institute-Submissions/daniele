# My Website

At this stage, you should have a name for your project so use it! Donâ€™t introduce the project as a Portfolio project for the diploma. In this section, describe what the project hopes to accomplish, who it is intended to target and how it will be useful to the target audience. 

For example, Love Maths is a site that hopes to demonstrate how pure JavaScript works in a real-world context. The site will be targeted toward people who not only love to implement more advanced JavaScript concepts but also maths. Love Maths is a fully responsive JavaScript maths game that will allow users to add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers.
